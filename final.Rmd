## Introduction
Environmental sustainability is the practice of using renewable and environmentally friendly practices in order to protect the earth's resources and provide for future generations. In this report we seek to understand the environmental impact of every state by analyzing data on landfills, water withdrawals, and power plant emissions for each state. As organic materials in landfills decompose they emit ozone depleting substances, also known as landfill gas (LFG), which have a negative effect on the environment and contribute to global warming. However, some landfills have LFG systems in place that collect emissions and lessen the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by the landfill. Water withdrawals refer to the amount of water withdrawn from a natural groundwater or surface water source. There are many activities such as agriculture, power generation, and manufacturing that require water and contribute to water withdrawals across the country. Water withdrawal has many associated problems including drought; however, more efficient transfer of water, storm water capture and water recycling can help reduce the impact of water withdrawals. Power plants use a variety of fuels to produce energy, including fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas. When these fuels are burned, they produce greenhouse gases, which contribute to global warming. Other renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal do not emit greenhouse gases, and are therefore much better for the environment. Different states may have different laws and regulations regarding these three areas and therefore have varying levels of environmental impact. Using data on landfills, water withdrawals and power plant emissions, we have created scores for each of the 50 states in order to rank the environmental impact of each state by combining and weighing several sustainability factors based on their importance and impact.

## Literature Review

### Landfills 
	In _The municipal solid waste landfill as a source of ozone-depleting substances in the United States and United Kingdom_ by E.L. Hodson, D. Martin, and R. G. Prinn, said researchers look to better understand the relationship between lingering ozone depleting substance (ODS) emissions and landfills who emit them. It is known fact that ODS influence climate change as they weaken the Earth’s defense against the sun: the ozone. When waste is not disposed of properly in landfills, it has the potential to release ODS.
<br>
	Luckily, the accumulation of ODS has depleted to the point where tropospheric concentrations are stable or decreasing (Hodson et. all, 2010, pg. 1). However, accurate predictions of future ODS emissions is necessary so that appropriate strategies are developed to minimize ozone loss. While there are several different types of ODS, for the sake of simplicity Hodson et. all decided to study the following four: CFC- 11 (trichlorofluoromethane), CFC-12 (dichlorodifluoromethane), CFC-113 (1,1,2-trichloro-1,2,2-trifluoroethane), and CH3CCl3 (1,1,1-trichloroethane) (Hodson et. all, 2010, pg. 1). These four were selected because of their high ozone depleting potential (ODP) and were historically released in large quantities into the atmosphere. Furthermore, they have long lifetimes until they dissolve and this makes these chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) even more relevant to study. Prior to this study, CFC-11, CFC-12, CFC-1143, and Ch3CCI3 have all been detected at above normal levels in landfills (Hodson et. all, 2010, pg. 2). Despite this compelling evidence, there are not any existing national inventory methods to quantify national ODS emissions from landfills (Hodson et. all, 2010, pg. 2). 
<br>
	In terms of methodology, Hodson et. all studied seven US and nine UK municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills with active gas management (2010, pg. 2). It is important to note that these landfills accept more than 50% of their waste from domestic and commercial sources (Hodson et. all, 2010, pg. 2). These landfills additionally varied in size- ranging from small, medium and large- to get the most representative sample. Most fields received one-time field sampling; however, one US MSW landfills was sampled every month for over a year (Hodson et. all, 2010, pg. 2).  The US MSW landfills had triplicate canister samples where they UK MSW landfills only had one canister samples. 
<br>
	After performing various chemistry based calculates to get the different percentages of gases that made up the various samples, Hodson et. all developed confidence intervals to best estimate the percentage these CFCs and CH3CCI3 make-up of the landfill emissions.  The results were the following: CFC-11 (0.037 - 0.074 Gg/y), CFC-12 (0.089 - 0.18 Gg/y), CFC-113 (0.0058 - 0.012 Gg/y), CH3CCl3 (0.012 - 0.024 Gg/y) (Hodson et. all, 2010, page 7). Understandably, the results without context do not mean much. Luckily, these quantities support the hypothesis that US and MK MSW landfills aren’t a significant source of these gases. In fact, these estimates indicate that US MSW landfills account for less than 1% of total US emissions (Hodson et. all, 2010, page 10). Thus, this study shows that monitoring and properly disposing of trash can keep ODS levels low, and can make a significant difference. 

### Water withdrawals
	In _Factors Governing Change in Water Withdrawals for U.S. Industrial Sectors from 1997 to 2002_, Hui Wang, Mitchell J. Small, and David A. Dzomback looked to understand why water withdrawal levels have been maintained despite a rapidly growing population. Wang et. all define water shortage as the total amount of water withdrawn from its source (2014, pg. 1). Water withdrawal can be alleviated through strategies like “water recycling and reuse, storm water capture, water transfer from more water-rich areas, and desalination of seawater” (Wang et. all, 2014, paragraph 1).  It was found that in 2002, U.S. sectors like agricultural activities, power generation, and food manufacturing were responsible for 50% of the water withdrawal (Wang et. all, 2014, paragraph 2). As the population grows, it relies more heavily on these basic sectors and can heavily impact water quantity, quality, and availability. Luckily, despite population growth rates of water withdrawal have been increasing at a much slower place. Inspired by this phenomena, Wang et. all decided to study 5 factors: “changes in population, GDP per capita, water use intensity, production structure, and consumption patterns” (Wang et. all, 2014, paragraph 4). 
<br>
	In terms of data collection, Wang et. all used the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) benchmark economic input-output (EIO) table from 1997 and 2002 to gain information about water withdrawals about summary sectors for both years (Wang et. all, 2014, paragraph 5). Wang et. all additionally used USGS data to get information about Thermoelectric power generation, Mining, Industrial, Irrigation, Residential, Public supply, Livestock, and Aquaculture (Wang et. all, 2014, paragraph 6). 
	Once the data was collected, Wang et. all created an Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIO-LCA). This uses independent variables that are subsections of the 5 main factors listed above to estimate the overall water withdrawal. From there, a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) was done to see how the variables independent variables influence the dependent variable as well as their relationship with each other. Upon extensive regression-based modeling, Wang et. all found that water use intensity was able to most accurately predict water withdrawal rates (Wang et. all, 2014, paragraph 34). Thus, it will be important to keep water withdrawal rates in mind when examining state to state.
	
### Power Plants Emissions
_North American Power Plant Air Emissions_ describes the Commission for Environmental Cooperation’s (CEC) 2011 report on criteria air pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel-fired power plants in North America for the year 2005, which was the most recent year for which data was available from United States, Canada, and Mexico, when the report was written. For the purpose of our research we will focus on their analysis of data collected on power plants in the United States. Criteria air pollutants (including sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) and greenhouse gases are atmospheric pollutants emitted by power plants. It is also possible for power plants to release trace metals, such as mercury, with certain fuels (Anonymous, 2012, page 1.1). About two-thirds of power generation in North America comes from fossil fuels including coal, residual fuel oil, and natural gas, which release air pollutants when burned (Anonymous, 2012, page 1.2).
<br>
The CEC’s methodology involved collecting public information on individual fossil fuel-fired power plants, including their installed capacity, electricity generation, technologies used, and fuels burned from public sources including each country’s national emission inventories. They used other public information to calculate estimates where data was absent. Limited availability of data narrowed the CEC’s analysis to data on SO2, NOX, and CO2 emissions (Anonymous, 2012, page 1.1). For the United States, they obtained data for CO2, NOX, SO2, methane, nitrous oxide and mercury emissions from 2,728 registered facilities. Data on PM-10 (particulate matter with a diameter of 10 mircormeters or less) and PM-2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less) emissions were only included for 1,182 of the facilities (Anonymous, 2012, page 1.2).
In their analysis, the CEC determined there was no significant change in the overall amount of emissions across North America between 2002 and 2005 (Anonymous, 2012, 1.3). In 2005, the net electricity generation in the U.S. was 49.7% from coal, 18.7% from natural gas, 5.46% from hydroelectric, 2.3% from renewable energy sources (including biomass, wind, geothermal, and solar), and 3% from other sources (Anonymous, 2012, pages 2-3). Electricity generation is the source of about one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S, contributing 39.3% of CO2 emissions nation-wide in 2005 (Anonymous, 2012, page 3). The CEC also found that coal-fired power plants were the largest contributor of SO2, NOx, PM-10, PM-2.5, and greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. (Anonymous, 2012, page 5).

### Summary
	Now that a sufficient background has been laid down about waste disposal, water withdrawal, and power consumption, this paper will delve into its area of focus. It is clear that extensive research has been in all of these areas individually; however, with a problem as large as climate change, an interdisciplinary approach is required to get a holistic overview of the problem without compromising the quality of information. As a result of this belief, this paper takes on a pragmatic worldview, constructed by a statistician, data-visualization expert, and a data analyst. All of these papers offer great depth, however, this research article will focus on assigning each of the 50 United States a score based on how they are navigating their relationship between waste disposal, power consumption, and water withdrawals. 


## Method Description


### Introduction
Our dataset consists of three major categories that contribute to environmental hazards: landfills, power plants, and water withdrawal. We have aggregated and cleaned a few different data sets to fit our needs and the data now lives inside one CSV document. There is quantitative, state by state data on landfills and waste, power consumption and emissions, and water withdrawals and water waste. 


### Landfills

##### Source
This data is from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Landfill Methane Outreach Program (LMOP). This data is current as of June 2017. The LMOP is an program that aims to reduce methane emissions from landfills. One of the ways they accomplish this goal is through gathering data on landfills and potential energy projects. 

##### Description
This data has two major parts, information about the itself landfill and information about methane saving projects at the landfill ("Access Landfill", 2017). The landfill data is a collection of 2,400 municipal solid waste landfills across the United States. This data has been collected largely in part due to the partnerships the EPA has with landfills. It includes landfills that both do and don’t report to the EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. The landfill specific data includes information like the state it’s located in, the landfill’s name, the landfill operator’s name (or organization), the county it’s located in, the latitude and longitude of the plant and the amount of trash it contains (in tons); to name a few. It also contains information about landfill operations including the year it opened, the year it has closed applicable, if they have methane protection projects going on, the year those methane protection projects started, and much more. The appendix has all the columns from this dataset. 

### Power Plant Emissions

##### Source
This data has also been collected by the EPA and is current as of 2014. It is a part of the EPA’s Emissions & Generated Resource Integrated Database (“eGRID”, 2017). The EPA describes eGRID as “a comprehensive source of data on the environmental characteristics of almost all electric power generated in the United States” (“eGRID”, 2017). They collect data on air emissions for nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide; emissions rates; net generation; resource mix; and many other attributes.


There are three major sources that the eGRID gets its data from:
<br>
1.	EPA/CAMD: this includes data reported to EPA by electric generating units to comply with the regulations in 40 CFR Part 75. Data include annual emissions of CO2, NOx, and SO2; ozone season emissions of NOx; and annual and ozone season generation and heat input. The data is available at https://www.epa.gov/airmarkets/
2.	EIA-860: this includes data reported to EIA on electric generators. Data include nameplate capacity, prime mover, primary fuel type, and indication of whether the generator is a combined-heat-and-power unit (EIA, 2016a).
3.	EIA-923: this includes data reported to EIA on fuel consumption and generation. Data include monthly generation and heat input at the unit or generator level for a subset of units and generators, and at the prime mover level for all plants. eGRID2014 uses unit- or generator-level data where available, and prime mover-level data for all other units and generators (EIA, 2016b).


##### Description
This data set comes with hundreds of columns; we have narrowed down those to just a few that are important to our mission. It describes the different amounts of emission of the different greenhouse gases, the amount of energy it produces and the type of energy it produces. It also shows summary statistics on the amount of renewable vs nonrenewable energy that it generates and combustible vs. noncombustible energy that it generates.


### Water Withdrawals

##### Source
The data was gathered from the United States Geological Survey (“Misson”). This agency collects, monitors and assesses data on different aspects of the United States’ geology for both policy makers and public interest. Their data contains information about many different aspects including land, air, water and everything in between. Our data is current as of 2010. 

##### Description
This data describes how much water is being used by the population of the United States. The data has been aggregated to reflect a state by state total for each column. Furthermore, it has been separated into many different parts, including where the water is coming from (surface water or groundwater), where it’s going to (agriculture, mining, industrial, livestock, aquaculture), who is using it (publicly supplied, domestically supplied), and the type of water (fresh or saline). There is also information on the populations for each state and the populations that use this water. 

### Analysis
  We will be performing multiple regression to see if there is a linear, predictive relationship between the rankings we assign to the states (dependent variable) and the scores that compose said ranking (independent variables) which are built on the following 6 categories: total emissions, total water withdrawals, total waste, percentage renewable, total LFG collected, and percentage non-combustible. The scoring system will be described in detail later below. This test was done to make sure how we weighted and created the scores aligns well with the overall ranking system. There are 3 checks to make sure multiple regression is the appropriate test to conduct: 

1. There is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
2. For each value of X, the probability distribution of Y has the same standard deviation and the y values are independent.
3. The dependent variable’s distribution is roughly normally distributed.

# Data Analysis

## Introduction

Our analysis revolves around six variables that we chose to represent the environmental impacts of the different states. The six variables were chosen out of our three major datasets (Water Withdrawals, Landfills, and Power Plants). First, we looked at the total amount of emissions in tons per capita per state. Second, we took the total water withdrawals in millions of gallons per day as a percentage of the population in each state. Thirdly, we looked at the amount waste in tons per person for each state. The fourth variable was the percentage of renewable energy vs the total energy produced by each state. The fifth variable was amount of emissions collected through an LFG system for each state. The last variable we took into consideration was the ratio of combustible fuel vs noncombustible fuels for each state.  

We knew that these variables didn't have the same amount of impact so the next step was to determine which variables weighed more heavily. We consulted an expert in the field, Lynn McGuire, as well as our own literature in order to determine how we would weigh each variable. Our research concluded that they should be placed in the following order:

1. Total emissions
2. Total water withdrawals
3. Total waste
4. Percentage of renewable energy
5. Total LFG collected
5. Percentage of non-combustibles

Total emissions, water withdrawals and waste were all ranked near the top because they were the most direct impacts on the environment. Greenhouse Gas emissions have been proven to directly cause climate change on Earth, lending this to be the first in our rankings of variables. Water withdrawals also directly contribute to the earth's climate problem because it is measuring the impact humans are having on the water ecosystems. Waste comes in third because it is both influencing ecosystems by poisoning land and contributing to the Greenhouse Gas emissions. Renewable energy and LFG collection are important to the prevention of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, the percentage of non-combustible gasses which have potential to be dangerous to our earth, but aren't directly influencing climate change. 
 
Once we ranked the variables we decided on a weighted system to determine each state's score. We weighted the more important variables heavier than the less important (based on our rankings). These weights are by no means the single correct solution, but rather what we found to be a fair system based off of our literature review. The total score comprised of:

25% : Total emissions <br>
20% : Water Withdrawals <br>
16% : Total waste <br>
14% : Percentage of renewable energy <br>
13% : Total LFG collected <br>
12% : Percentage of non-combustibles <br>

These factors contributed to our total score for each state. The rest of our analysis was completed based on this score.

### Summary Statistics
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(sum.stats)

```

<br>

## Multivariate Regression

We conducted amultivaraite regression test to check that our scores were assigned with states' ranks in an appropiate and linear fashion.

### Statistical Checks

The results of the checks to make sure multiple regression is an appropriate test as as follows:

#### 1.	There is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables. 

Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a strong linear relationship in the scatterplots above. However, we are not seeing any different types of patterns such as logarithmic or exponential functions which are even more worrisome. As a result, we will proceed cautiously. 
<br>
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("linear_regression.R")
a
b
c
d
e
f
```

#### 2. For each value of X, the probability distribution of Y has the same standard deviation and the y values are independent. 

The easiest way to evaluate this check is to check the graphs of the residuals given the fitted value. The variability of the residuals should fairly consistent given any value of x and there shouldn’t be a clear pattern. 
<br>
```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("linear_regression.R")
p.emissions
p.withdrawals
p.waste.pop
p.combustion
p.lfg.collected
p.renews

```
As displayed by the graph, it seems to be an okay fit! There isn’t a clear pattern to the residuals and they appear to vary by approximately the same amount. 

#### 3. The dependent variable’s distribution is roughly normally distributed

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, evaluted=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("linear_regression.R")
h
```
As one can see, there is a uniform distribution for scores. This is not a normal distribution; however, there is a lack of skew or signs of being bimodal and thus we will proceed with caution.

<br>
<br>

### Results

The following equation was created by the linear regression function in R: <br>
<br>
*Predicted Rank* = 85.655 - 39.127 (*emissions*) - 13.994 (*withdrawals*) - 24.256 (*waste*) – 12.535 (*combustion*) - 15.064 (*lfg.collected*) – 6.114 (*renews*)
<br>
<br>
  By creating a linear regression function in R, R additionally runs an F-test. The null hypothesis for an f-test is that a model with only a y-intercept is just as good a fit as the model created through linear regression. After conducting the f-test, we received a sample statistic of 109.9 If we were to conduct a million f-tests with a million different randomly selected samples, the odds of getting a more extreme f-statistic is ~0.0002%. As a result, we can reject the null hypothesis. This means that we have created a model that is better than a model with only the y-intercept.
<br>
<br>
	Overall, this confirms that we have made a model for assigning ranks that is fairly predictable which is encouraging. This means that if one only knew information about the 6 independent variables, they could use this equation to get a predicted rank that would be very close to correct.  
<br>

# Discussion 

Overall, we synthesized information from three unique datasets that had one common binding: the 50 United States. We picked out the six most important traits across all three of these data frames, and ranked as well as weighted them based on importance. As discussed above, the word importance is inherently subjective. If one were to choose different weights for these six traits, one would receive a completely different rank for the 50 states. Thus, it is here we will check our assumptions. We assigned these weights based off of feedback from Lynn McGuire, a subject matter expert in environmental conservation, and her experience in the field. By incorporating her feedback as well as key takeaways from the literature review, we hope to mitigate our bias.

In addition to receiving feedback from subject matter experts, we also ran a multivariate regression test to make sure one could predict rank based off of these scores we assigned to these 6 factors by states. The model proved to be statistically significant and assure us that our math checked out. That being said, all models are inherently wrong; they just give us an idea of approximation. To clarify, this multivariate regression analysis gave us assurance that our math was correct, but does not affirm our ranking system itself is inherently correct.

As for the rankings, the overall order of the results did not surprise us. Washington has the best overall score and the state of Wyoming has the worst score. Here is a breakdown for Washington’s ranks on our 6 factors.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, evaluted=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("script.R")
library(knitr)
kable(wa.ranks)
```

Washington ranks number two for both combustables and renewable energy sources. We were curious why this might be, and found that it might have something to do with their laws regarding energy. In 2008, Washington began the Energy Independence Act, which requires large electrical utility companies to use renewable energy. This act sets requirements for these companies that have to do with both conservation and the utilization of renewable energy sources. Companies must attempt to conserve energy in an effective manner, creating a 10 year plan and making 2 year benchmarks. They also must hit renewable energy standards that increase over time, totaling to 15% renewables by 2020 ("Energy Independence", paragraph 2). Regulations like these force the increase the amount of renewable energy generated in the state and are directly responsible for the 76% of energy in the state of Washington being renewable. Ambitious atricles like _A 100% wind, water, sunlgish (WWS) all-sector energy plan for Washington State)_ even claim that Washington state could get 100% of its energy from wind, water, and sunlight by 2050 (Jacobson et. all, 2016, pg. 75)

Here is a breakdown for Wyoming’s score, ranking number 50, on our 6 factors.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, evaluted=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(knitr)
kable(wy.ranks)
```

Looking at Wyoming’s scores we can see that they did poorly in a few different areas. First in the LFG collection they ranked last. This is probably because they don’t have any LFG collection systems at any of their landfills. However, in their defense, they only have a total of 4 landfills in the entire state, the smallest number of landfills in all of the US. If we look at the number of landfills that don’t have LFG collection systems for each state, Wyoming actually ties for 4th.

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, evaluted=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
kable(head(wy.landfill, 8L))
kable(tail(wy.landfill, 8L))
```

This proves that if we would have chosen some other way to measure LFG Collection, Wyoming’s scores have changed significantly. It is also further proof that our scores are subjective and it shows the importance of disclosure of our methods and calculations that lead us to these scores. 

Wyoming ranked second to last in the total emissions and didn’t do well in the renewables or combustible power sections as well. This is probably in part due to the fact that they are the number one resource of coal in the United States, mining almost 400 million tons of coal per year ("Coal Mining", paragraph 6). Using coal to produce energy emits large amounts of Sulfur Dioxide (SO2) and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) ("Air Pollution", 2016, paragraph 1).This is an avoidable problem, as it has been shown management of these wastes at a primary and secondary level can control the pollution via the source (Tiwary, 2001, pg. 1)

<br>

# Conclusion
In conclusion, we creaking a ranking system that evaluated the 50 United States and assigned them each a score depending on how well they did for each of the 6 variables. Our system for assigning scores proved to be statistically significant on a multivaraite regression model, which simply means our system predicts rank in an appropriate way given the different weights we chose to assign to the six variables. We acknowledge choosing weighs can be subjectective and thus tried to reduce this liability via information from our literature review. Overall, we created a system that offers holistic breath that a research paper has yet to do. We hope this inspires people to be more conscious of their impact on all three facets - landfill, power, and water withdrawal - regardless of state.
